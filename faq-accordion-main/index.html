              We provide front-end challenges that include professional web
              designs. These allow you to practice building websites in a
              realistic workflow. Taking these challenges will help you improve
              your skills, gain experience creating websites, and build up an
              incredible project portfolio. We also have a large community of
              developers, so it's a great way to meet other devs!

              The majority of our challenges are free, yes. We do have some that
              are premium and require a Pro subscription to access. It will say
              on each challenge whether they are free or premium, so it's easy
              to tell the difference.

              Definitely! Please do feel free to use whatever you build in your
              portfolio. Helping developers add professional-looking projects to
              their portfolio was one of the reasons we created this platform!

              The best (and quickest) way to get help on a challenge is in our
              Discord server. There are thousands of other developers in there,
              so it's a great place to ask questions. We even have a dedicated
              "help" channel! If you haven't joined yet, you can get an invite
              to our Discord server here.
